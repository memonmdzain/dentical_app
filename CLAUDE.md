## Branch & Git Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `master` | Production only. Never commit directly. |
| `develop` | Integration branch. Merge here after each working feature. |
| `android/feature/*` | One branch per feature |
| `android/fix/*` | Bug fixes |

### Flow
```
android/feature/xxx → develop (PR) → master (PR + release tag)
```

### IMPORTANT — Code Access Between Sessions
- Merge working features to `develop` after each test
- New session: tap + → Add from GitHub → select files needed
- Claude reads from whatever branch you share

### Current active branch
`android/feature/treatments-visits` — treatments, visits, payment mode, crash fixes in progress

---

## CI/CD — GitHub Actions

- Path filters per module
- Android debug APK on every push to develop
- APK artifact downloadable for 7 days
- Public repo = unlimited free minutes
- Uninstall old APK before installing new one

---

## Tech Stack ✅

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Language | Kotlin |
| UI | Jetpack Compose |
| Architecture | MVVM |
| Local DB | Room v3 |
| DI | Hilt |
| Navigation | Jetpack Navigation Compose |
| Auth MVP | Local username/password + roles |
| Auth Phase 2 | Google OAuth |
| Backend Phase 2 | PostgreSQL |

---

## Seeded Users (fresh install)

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| admin | admin123 | ADMIN |
| dr.smith | dentist123 | DENTIST |
| dr.jones | dentist123 | DENTIST |

> Dummy dentists for testing — removed when Settings feature is built.

---

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| ADMIN | Full access, manage staff, roles, delete |
| DENTIST | Own appointments, treatments, patients |
| STAFF | Appointments, patients, billing |

---

## Database

- Version: 6, exportSchema: false
- `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` enabled — wipes DB if no migration path found (dev phase only; remove before launch)
- Migration 1→2: patients table rebuilt
- Migration 2→3: appointments table rebuilt with type + dentistId
- Migration 3→4: treatments + visits + treatment_visit_cross_ref tables added
- Migration 4→5: tables recreated without SQL DEFAULT clauses (Room schema fix) + paymentMode column on visits
- Migration 5→6: force clean slate for any device with a broken version-5 schema (same drop+recreate)

---

## Data Loading Strategy

### Phase 1 — Local (current)
- Room + Kotlin Flow: reactive streams, emit only on DB writes → already "live cache"
- ViewModels collect flows into StateFlow — data retained across recompositions
- UI screens lazy-load via LazyColumn; data fetched only for the active screen
- No explicit TTL needed: Room invalidates its query cache on writes, not time

### Phase 2 — Backend
- Repository layer will add an in-memory cache (Map + timestamp) per entity type
- TTL default: 5 minutes. Stale check: `System.currentTimeMillis() - cachedAt > ttlMs`
- Cache hit → return cached Flow. Cache miss / stale → network fetch → write to Room → Room flow emits
- Room DB continues to serve as the persistent offline cache between sessions
- `CacheManager` singleton (Hilt @Singleton) will hold the TTL map, injected into repositories

- [x] Treatments + Visits (add, detail, status, payment mode, financial summary)
- [ ] Dashboard stats
- [ ] Billing & invoices
- [ ] Push reminders
- [ ] Settings — staff management

### Phase 2 — Cloud
- [ ] PostgreSQL backend
- [ ] Google OAuth
- [ ] FCM push notifications

### Phase 3 — Patient App
- [ ] android/patient/ Kotlin app
- [ ] Book, view records, pay

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Monorepo | Yes |
| Single master branch | Yes — CI path filters handle isolation |
| Staff/patient apps separate | Yes |
| Jetpack Compose | Yes |
| MVVM + Hilt + Room | Yes |
| Patient code from 10001 | Yes |
| Merge to develop after each feature | Yes — so Claude can read code |
| Week view: date strip + count badges | Yes |
| Month view: grid + count badges | Yes |
| Edit disabled on closed status | Yes |
| Treatment sections: Ongoing / Past | Yes |
| fallbackToDestructiveMigration (dev) | Yes — remove before Play Store launch |
| Phase 2 TTL cache default | 5 minutes, in-memory, per repository |

---

## Termux Commands

```bash
cd ~/storage/dentical_app

# Unzip Claude output
unzip ~/storage/downloads/filename.zip -d ~/scaffold_temp
cp -r ~/scaffold_temp/dentical_app/* ~/storage/dentical_app/
rm -rf ~/scaffold_temp

# Commit & push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push origin android/feature/scaffold

# Merge to develop (after testing)
git checkout develop
git merge android/feature/scaffold
git push origin develop
```

---

## Session Tips (Token Saving)

- Start each session by sharing CLAUDE.md + relevant code files via + → Add from GitHub
- State the feature and decisions upfront — no need to re-discuss
- One session = one feature
- For bug fixes just paste the error — say "fix it"
- str_replace edits are cheaper than full file rewrites
